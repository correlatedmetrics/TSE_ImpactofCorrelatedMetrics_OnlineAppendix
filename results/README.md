# Experimental Results

**Correlation Analysis** - Results of correlation analysis for each of the studied datasets.

**Mitigated Metrics** - The sets of mitigated metrics for each of the publicly-available defect datasets.

**RQ4** - Results of RQ4 which consist of:
1. Performance (Raw performance estimates of (1) non-mitigated and (2) mitigated models, and (3) performance difference of non-mitigated and mitigated models plots)
2. Performance Stability (Raw performance stabilities of (1) non-mitigated and (2) mitigated models, and (3) performance stability ratio of non-mitigated and mitigated models plots)
